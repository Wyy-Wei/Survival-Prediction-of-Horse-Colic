# Survival-Prediction-of-Horse-Colic


## Introduction

Colic in horses, simply refering to abdominal pain, is one of the most common problems in equine practice. It has a significant economic impact on the racehorse industry and is a major concern for owners.

Equine colic can be divided into 2 major categories; gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal. Horseâ€™s vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, and mucus membrane color) is important information for diagnosis. Nongastrointestinal colic cases can usually be excluded based on physical examination findings; these include signs of abdominal discomfort due to urinary urolithiasis and disorders of reproductive, nervous, respiratory, or musculoskeletal systems. Causes of gastrointestinal colic (GC) are gut distension, tension on the root of mesentery, ischemia, deep ulcers in the stomach or bowel, and peritoneal pain\cite{colic}.

The purpose of this study was to explore the symptoms of horses with colic and predict survival, with a view to providing equine practitioners with a better reference to equine colic condition, which may contribute to timely treatment and higher colic survival rates.

## Data Description

The pathology data of 368 horses presented with signs of colic is reviewed. It includes 28 attributes about the vital signs and surgical information of horses including rectal temperature, mucous membranes, nasogastric reflux, etc. The attributes can be continuous, discrete, and nominal.
